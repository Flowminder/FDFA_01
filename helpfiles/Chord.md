Chord
-----

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Chord diagram is another representation of migration movements
between countries or administrative units.

*"A chord diagram represents flows or connections between several
entities. Each entity is represented by a fragment on the outer part of
the circular layout. Then, arcs are drawn between each entities. The
size of the arc is proportional to the importance of the flow."
(<a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/chord.html" target="_blank">From
Data to Viz</a>)*

Larger is the arc, larger is the migration movement from one entitiy to
the next. One filter can be applied to the data:

-   The widget `Maximum number of relations` determines the number of
    relations to draw.

### Data sources and methods

The migration **estimates** for *international* and *internal* movements
come from two different models and data sources:

-   `International`: ADRI database (UNDESA): Iterative Proportional
    Fitting to disaggregate national estimates to subnational level
-   `Internal`: IMPUMSI database (censuses, 40 countries): statistical
    model fed by Remote sensed and other geographic data to out-predict
    internal migration in countries where census data on migration is
    not available

These migration figures are **estimates** of international and internal
migration of 2010. These figures are not meant to represent the actual
count of migrants. See the section *Background & methods* for more
