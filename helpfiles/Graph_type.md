Visualisation
-------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These selection boxes let you set the type of graphic to overlay on the
map:  
\* `Origin-destination arcs`: show arcs of the origin and destination of
the migration movements  
\* `Columns total`: show the total number of migrants at origin or
destination.

The visualisation will vary according to the choice of `Focus` and
`direction`. For instance:

-   `Focus` is set to *Global* and `Direction` to *Emigration*:
    -   `Origin-destination arcs`: show top emigration trajectories
        (choose the number of trajectories per administrative unit or
        country with the drop-down menu `Number of relations`)
    -   `Columns total`: show the total number of migrants at origin,
        i.e. emigration in home country or home administrative unit
-   `Focus` is set to *Global* and `Direction` to *Immigration*:
    -   `Origin-destination arcs`: show top immigration trajectories
    -   `Columns total`: show the total number of migrants at
        destination, i.e. immigration in host country or host
        administrative unit
-   `Focus` is set to *Administative area* and `Direction` to
    *Emigration*:
    -   `Origin-destination arcs`: show top emigration trajectories from
        the selected administrative area
    -   `Columns total`: show the total number of migrants from the
        selected administrative area in the various destinations as well
        as the total having left from the selected administrative area
